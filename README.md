# MusicPile
MusicPile provides access to music information via a web mashup using a microservice architecture.  

All the data consists in information regarding artists, albums, tracks, charts and is aggregated from Spotify and Genius.  
The app is written using the MERN Stack and offers a public API. One of the more interesting parts of the project is the custom cache system.

If you are interested, you can find the live project [here](https://musicpile.co.uk).
